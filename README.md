### **Code Explanation:**

This script models and visualizes the geometry of cracks in a material under stress, specifically in the context of fracture mechanics. It simulates two circular crack contours, with radii determined by key mechanical properties such as the stress intensity factor (KI), Young's modulus (ay), and Poisson's ratio (v). These contours represent cracks or fracture features in the material, and the connections between them depict the potential crack propagation and interaction.

The code has been implemented in both **Python** and **MATLAB**, allowing users to visualize and analyze crack behavior in materials using either environment.

- **Inputs/Constants:**
  - `theta`: A set of angles between 0 and 2Ï€, parameterizing the circular crack contours.
  - `d`: A constant representing the vertical distance between the crack layers.
  - `KI`, `ay`, `v`: Material properties used for fracture mechanics calculations. `KI` is the stress intensity factor, `ay` relates to the material's stiffness, and `v` is Poisson's ratio.

- **Model Construction:**
  - The radii `r1` and `r2` are computed based on mechanical properties and trigonometric functions, reflecting the relationship between material stress and crack geometry.
  
- **3D Points:**
  - Coordinates for each crack contour (`x1, y1, z1`, `x2, y2, z2`) are calculated, with multiple contours at different `y`-levels representing layers or steps in crack propagation.

- **Plotting:**
  - The 3D plot is visualized, with blue and red lines representing the two crack contours, and black connecting lines indicating potential crack propagation or interaction between the contours.

### **Usage:**
The model is used to study crack propagation, material failure, and stress distribution in fracture mechanics. It provides a visual understanding of how cracks evolve and interact within a material, which is crucial for engineering applications involving structural integrity and material performance.


This version explicitly mentions both Python and MATLAB implementations, giving a broader context for users who may choose either language for their analysis and visualization.
